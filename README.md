## Idea

It is an initiative to make the society clean and free from dirty pickets.It allows users to click pictures of garbage lots and inform others on the application (along with the location of the place). Admin (NGO persons) would confirm the dirty area and would create an event and post it on the application. Volunteers will RSVP to join the event and contribute their services to clean the area. People who cannot directly participate can donate things for cleaning or donate money. People can also donate money through bitcoins.
